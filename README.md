# How to install and run Docker successfully on Windows 10 machine

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code. In this article we will focus on Windows 10 machine.
In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application. Docker Container is a standardized unit which can be created on the fly to deploy a application or environment. It could be an Ubuntu container, CentOS container, etc. to full-fill the requirement from an operating system point of view. Also, it could be an application-oriented container like CakePHP container or a Tomcat-Ubuntu container etc.
